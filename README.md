# [Quick Start](https://github.com/omoluabidotcom/) 

You will import the dbb_todoapi.sql file into your 
database and change the parameters in config/Database.php
file to your own values.

For api request the url should be as follows
api/Task/  for Task
api/Todo/  for Todo
api/User/  for User

**Note: The database has some missing numbering, this is**
**due to some data been deleted from the table while testing.**
